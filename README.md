# permute
Simple program to generate all possible permutations of a given string

Created by looking at the Java version of the following page:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/

This would be the Xojo implementation. Feel free to improve it if you want. Test it using short (4, 5 characters) strings initially as it quickly suffers from slowness with longer strings
